Anybody's welcome to this Indian Premier League Get Alliss project.

So what exactly is Indian primally?

So it is basically our cricket league contested during summer of every year in India in which various

eight teams are going to be participating in it anymore.

So basically those teams are, let's say Punjab, Rajasthan, Mumbai and all this team.

And, you know, it is the most outstanding cricket league in the world.

And in 2019, ETRAN, it's ranked second by average attendance among all the sports leagues.

So no question can arise what type of analysis you can perform on this.

Ippolita, let's say you have to analyse total runs across the season.

So from the start you can come to a conclusion year between the season.

I have somewhere around 20 to Kieran's.

Let's say you have to analyse performance of a particular batsman.

So using this pie chart, you can come to such conclusion.

Let's say for each and every team of IPL, you have to conclude your what is a batting performance of

the team.

So basically you can come to such conclusion.

What is a task this season in various various season by teams?

Let's see how many matches played by our teams and in how many matches they are going to win.

So basically, you have to perform such analysis on your data.

You have to find your insights from your data.

So let's go ahead to the project.
